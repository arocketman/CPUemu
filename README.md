* Move between Data registers       (e.g : MOVE D0,D1)
* Move between Number and data register (e.g : MOVE 4,D2)
* Addition between data registers   (e.g : ADD  D1,D2)
* Addition between Number and data registers (e.g : ADD 4,D2)
* Subtraction between data registers (e.g : SUB D1,D2)
* Subtraction between Number and data register (e.g : SUB 5,D2)
